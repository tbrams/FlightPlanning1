# FlightPlanning1
This is the first Google Sheet based planning tool I created while studying for my PPL license. This one is based on 
the Flight Plan used at Copenhagen Airtaxa and comes with support for a few of their TP-9 models. 

Everything is controlled from a Google Sheet with this code installed.

When opening the sheet the weather data is checked automatically. You will be warned if a newer METAR has been issued since you originally made the 
plan. Updating is done easily but might obviously change a lot of performance calculations.
